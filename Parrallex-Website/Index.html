                        Roller coaster, elevated railway with steep inclines and descents that carries a train of passengers through sharp curves and sudden changes of speed and direction for a brief thrill ride. Found mostly in amusement parks as a continuous loop, it is a popular leisure activity.
                        <br><br>
                        The activity was taken to Paris in 1804 in the form of a ride called the Russian Mountains (Les Montagnes Russes). Small wheels were added to the sleds on this ride, a key modification that later persuaded some historians to credit it as the first wheeled coaster.

                        It is not a good idea to venture out into the mountains alone – unless you happen to be a distant relative of the mythical Himalayan yeti (or an aspiring Reinhold Messner, the first person in the world to have climbed all fourteen 8000m peaks, including the first oxygen-less ascent and later the first solo ascent of Everest).

                    Cycling (also known as bicycling or biking) is the riding of bicycles (also cycles, or bikes) for leisure or as part of competition. In many countries, the cycle is also an important mode of transport, more so in Asia (especially in Southeast Asia) and Africa. In Europe, cycling is predominantly a recreational activity
                    <br><br>
                    The continent is very much the hub of cycling as a competitive sport, but modern Europeans are increasingly inclined to use the bike as a favoured mode of transport (from home to office – and back). Indeed, across the world today, the cycle is the preferred means of conveyance for many commuters.

                    Paragliding is an adventure sport where a person glides through the air using a wide canopy, a fabric wing that’s made up of a large number of interconnected cells. In paragliding, the pilot “takes off” from an elevated position, usually the top of a hill or mountain, then uses wind forces to help him maintain flight — sometimes even gaining altitudes! Throughout the flight, the pilot sits in a harness suspended below the wing.
                    <br><br>
                    In Cape Town, there are two popular paragliding launch spots: Signal Hill and Lion’s Head, which are 350 meters and 669 meters above sea level respectively. Lion’s Head is the more popular spot, since it allows for a longer flight and better flight scenery.                </P>

Surfing’s roots dwell pre-modern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the game was practiced by both men and women from all social strata from royalty to commoners. Organized competitions helped to counter this negative image and to win surfing some social respectability. Here is everything you need to know about surfing in India.
